    Navigate to the **'Analisis Prestasi Pelajar'** section to view interactive visualizations that:
    1.  **Correlate** academic performance with factors like attendance and preparation time.
    2.  **Compare** performance distributions across gender, department, and income levels.
    3.  **Track** academic progression and the interactive effects of key habits over time.
